# Password-Generator-Wooley-3

## Description
Here, I have developed a very unique password generator which selects random data as user selected criteria to fit the needs. It takes into account the length of the password and the character types as required and selected by the user.  

This application is intended to create a strong, safe, and secure password for whatever site you may need. It will generate the password based on the criteria selected by the user and it will be awesome!

This project taught me alot about how in depth the javascript language is. As with many other programming languages, I learned that javascript will complement a webpage HTML layout very well by suiting actions. Now to be specific, I learned a few new methods that I will have to apply in future projects: The .split() and .join() method for strings, the .concat() method for arrays, the String.fromCharCode() method for ASCII conversion, and others. I will be updating this project later but it works pretty well. If any bugs are found please let me know so I can accept a pull request and make this application even more excellent.

By using this project, the user could have one of the safest and foolproof passwords to his/her site to be protected.

## Project
This project is not to be updated often, please reach out if any bugs are detected. Everything was seemingly working fine as far as execution of this program. As a developer, understand that nothing is perfect and bugs will always be possible. Again, it's nothing a little refactoring of code can't fix up!
